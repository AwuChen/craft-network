The Craft Network was made using data collected in-person from craftsmen in Kyoto, Japan and the visualization was rendered using React bindings for the **force-graph** [suite](https://vasturiano.github.io/react-force-graph/example/forcegraph-dependencies) of components: [force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph) (2D HTML Canvas), [3d-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph) (ThreeJS/WebGL), [3d-force-graph-vr](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph-vr) (A-Frame) and [3d-force-graph-ar](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph-ar) (AR.js).
